I am an evolutionary geneticist who combines experimental and computational methods to study two fundamental topics in evolutionary biology: the evolution of multicellularity and the origins of species.

My main work focuses on a long-term evolutionary experiment exploring the transition to multicellularity using the ‘snowflake’ yeast - a simple model of nascent multicellularity. My post-doctoral study examining the role of oxygen on the evolution of multicellular size allowed us to lift the strongest constraint on the size evolution of our model system, letting me develop a multicellular long-term evolution experiment (MuLTEE). My long-term research goal is to run this MuLTEE for over a decade to monitor the consequences of macroscopic multicellularity on the fitness, life-cycle, genome, transcriptome, and phenotype of individual cells and multicellular groups.

To study how species originate and are maintained, I examine the genetic mechanisms of reproductive isolation in yeast. Distinct yeast species can mate and form viable hybrids, but their sexual gametes are almost sterile due to >10% genetic distance at the single nucleotide level. During my doctoral research, I developed a genetic technique that allowed us to dissolve the reproductive barrier between two yeast species, increasing their gamete survival from ~0.5% to 32%, elevating it to the levels seen between some non-hybrid crosses. The improvement in hybrid fertility will allow yeast geneticists to generate viable hybrid crosses across yeast species with similar genetic features, allowing us to generate scientifically and commercially valuable yeast crosses.
