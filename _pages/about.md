I am an evolutionary geneticist who combines experimental and computational methods to study two fundamental topics in evolutionary biology: the evolution of multicellularity and the origins of species.

**The Multicellularity Long-Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE)**

My main research explores the evolutionary transition from unicellular organisms into multicellular organisms by experimentally evolving this process in the laboratory. Early work on the evolution of multicellularity focused on group formation, including studies on 'snowflake' yeast where single-celled yeast evolved multicellular clusters. However, these studies were kept short as the size of snowflake yeast, a key trait for the transition from simple cell clusters to integrated multicellular individuals, remained constrained despite strong daily selection for size.

**Low-oxygen is a key limitation in snowflake yeast size evolution:**

In 2018, as I transitioned from my PhD work to postdoctoral research at [Will Ratcliff's Lab](https://ratclifflab.biosci.gatech.edu), I came up with an idea to address the key issue of why previous work with this model system was limited to microscopic size. Inspired by [Andy Knoll's](https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/people/andrew-h-knoll) papers and leveraging my diverse experience on yeast metabolism from [Duncan Greig's](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/4336) lab, I designed this experiment to test the constraints on the evolution of multicellular size in snowflake yeast under different oxygen and metabolic conditions.

Long story short, oxygen was indeed the key to size evolution in snowflake yeast! Low oxygen concentrations strongly suppressed multicellular size evolution over 5,000 generations, the environment in which these yeast were previously evolved. In contrast, snowflake yeast evolved in supplemental (near modern-day level) oxygen showed the fastest increase in average multicellular size. Yeast, unlike obligate eukaryotes limited by oxygen concentration in 600 million-year-old oceans, can also grow without respiring oxygen through fermentation. Populations in this treatment group also evolved large size, doubling in radius in just 150 days, all of which are discussed [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23104-0).

**Evolution of macroscopic Multicellularity in snowflake yeast:**

Evolving larger size is crucial for multicellular organisms to undergo significant shifts in biophysical properties, cell biology, and genomics/proteomics. Having identified the constraint on size evolution and inspired by Richard Lenski and colleagues' LTEE with bacteria, I decided snowflake yeast was now "ready" for a long-term evolution experiment. Once the experiment reached the 600-day (3,000 generation) mark, five snowflake yeast populations evolved macroscopic multicellular clusters 20,000 times larger in volume, reaching millimeter scales visible to the naked eye! These macroscopic yeast grew clonally, starting from single cells, forming clusters containing an average of 300,000 cells—a dramatic shift, considering snowflake yeast in previous work had only a few hundred cells on average, all explored in detail in [our Nature paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06052-1).

In our subsequent work, we investigated the [biophysics of branch entanglement](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.14.011008), the [coexistence of distinct phenotypic size classes of snowflake yeast](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-024-02367-y), the [molecular mechanisms behind cellular elongation and macroscopic multicellularity](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn2706) (such as the chaperone protein Hsp90), and emergent biophysical mechanisms like spontaneous [fluid flows](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213004/) that alleviate constraints on nutrient transport. Recently, we discovered that yeast in the MuLTEE have undergone whole-genome duplication and further increases in chromosome copy number (aneuploidies), aiding cell-level changes that drive macroscopic multicellular adaptations—all explored in our most recent [Nature paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08689-6) (also see the nice ['behind the paper'](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/a-long-term-evolution-experiment-for-whole-genome-duplication?channel_id=behind-the-paper) post from Kai about the story of this paper, which shows that studies at this scale are only possible through the dedicated work of many individuals, many of whom are almost always young scientists!).

**The future of the MuLTEE:**

While the MuLTEE does not recapitulate the exact historical path of multicellular evolution, it showcases the first real-time evidence of the transition from single-celled individuals to multicellular individuals with novel cell biology, biophysics, and cluster size. These changes occur at the cost of single-cell fitness and lead to the entrenchment of the multicellular phenotype. Furthermore, the MuLTEE is not only an experiment about how yeast could have evolved multicellular individuals de novo but also a long-term evolution experiment of whole-genome duplication, aneuploidy, and reductive evolution of mitochondria, akin to mitochondrion-related organelles (MROs). This experiment is likely to generate more exciting research, which I am super excited to see by continuing it for the next 1-2 decades.

Here is a research highlight about key aspects of this work, written by Or Shalev and colleagues: [Replaying the Evolution of Multicellularity](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2023.07.007)

**Other research:**

Additionally, I am interested in understanding the genetic mechanisms of reproductive isolation and species formation in yeast. In a [key study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.12.038), we discovered that by repressing just two genes (SGS1 and MSH2) during meiosis, we could dramatically increase hybrid fertility between two diverged yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. This genetic manipulation raised hybrid gamete survival from less than 1% to 32%, comparable to non-hybrid crosses. This finding demonstrates that anti-recombination is the principal cause of hybrid sterility between these species. 

By overcoming this barrier, we produced viable, euploid hybrid gametes with recombinant genomes from highly diverged parents. This discovery not only advances our understanding of speciation but also provides a valuable tool for yeast researchers. It enables the creation of hybrid strains with novel properties, facilitates trait mapping across species, and opens new possibilities for both basic research and biotechnology applications.

Here is our review paper on this topic: [Evolution and Molecular Bases of Reproductive Isolation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gde.2022.101952)
