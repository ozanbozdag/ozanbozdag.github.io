I teach undergraduate and graduate-level courses at Georgia Tech.

**•**	**Evolutionary Biology** (BIOS 3600 / BIOL 6600)

This course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary biology and is designed for intermediate undergraduate and beginning graduate students interested in the subject. By taking this course, students will adopt population thinking (as opposed to typological thinking), interpret figures and tables from the primary literature, and understand how evolutionary forces have contributed to the diversity of life on Earth.

The course covers a range of topics, including the history of life, major transitions in evolution, speciation, phylogeny, natural selection, fitness, adaptation, sexual selection, experimental evolution, genetics of natural selection, genetic drift, genome evolution, and evo-devo.

Optional textbooks:

**•** Evolution by Carl Bergstrom and Lee Dugatkin  
**•** Evolutionary Analysis by Jon Herron and Scott Freeman


**•** **Communicating Biological Research** (BIOS 4460)

This course is designed to help students develop their oral and poster presentation skills. Students will learn how to effectively engage their audience when presenting scientific topics, as well as how to present and discuss their own research results critically. In addition, students will learn how to think critically and provide constructive feedback on their classmates' presentations. Although the course focuses on improving students' ability to give engaging talks on research projects, the skills they will develop are applicable to a wide range of future careers.

In the first weeks of the course, we cover a range of topics, including how to structure a talk, prepare effective slides, analyze examples of well-structured talks, deliver a good talk, and construct an effective poster presentation.
