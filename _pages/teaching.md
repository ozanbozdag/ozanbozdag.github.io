I teach undergraduate and graduate and level courses at Georgia Tech.

**•**	**Evolutionary Biology** (BIOS 3600 / BIOL 6600)

This course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary biology. It is designed for **intermediate undergraduate students** and **beginning graduate students** who are interested in the subject. By taking this course, students will adopt population thinking (as opposed to typological thinking), interpret figures and tables from primary literature, and understand how evolutionary forces have contributed to the diversity of life on Earth.

The course covers a range of topics, including the history of life, major transitions in evolution, speciation, phylogeny, natural selection, fitness, adaptation, sexual selection, experimental evolution, genetics of natural selection, genetic drift, genome evolution, and evo devo.

Optional text books:

**•** Evolution by Carl Bergstrom and Lee Dugatkin
**•** Evolutionary Analysis by Jon Herron and Scott Freeman

**•** **Communicating Biological Research** (BIOS 4460)

This course aims to help you develop your oral and poster presentation skills. You will learn how to effectively engage your audience when presenting scientific topics, as well as how to present and discuss your own research results critically. In addition, you will learn how to think critically and provide constructive feedback on your classmates' presentations. Although the course focuses on improving your ability to give engaging talks on research projects, the skills you'll develop are applicable to a wide range of future careers.

In the first weeks of the course, I cover a range of topics, including how to structure a talk, how to prepare effective slides, examples of well-structured talks, and how to deliver a good talk, how to construct an effective poster presentation.
